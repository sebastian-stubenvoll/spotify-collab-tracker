     * Base class to create strongly typed Svelte components.
     * This only exists for typing purposes and should be used in `.d.ts` files.
     *
     * ### Example:
     *
     * You have component library on npm called `component-library`, from which
     * you export a component called `MyComponent`. For Svelte+TypeScript users,
     * you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a `index.d.ts`:
     * ```ts
     * import { SvelteComponentTyped } from "svelte";
     * export class MyComponent extends SvelteComponentTyped<{foo: string}> {}
     * ```
     * Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension
     * to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file
     * with TypeScript:
     * ```svelte
     * <script lang="ts">
     * 	import { MyComponent } from "component-library";
     * </script>
     * <MyComponent foo={'bar'} />
     * ```
     *
     * #### Why not make this part of `SvelteComponent(Dev)`?
     * Because
     * ```ts
     * class ASubclassOfSvelteComponent extends SvelteComponent<{foo: string}> {}
     * const component: typeof SvelteComponent = ASubclassOfSvelteComponent;
     * ```
     * will throw a type error, so we need to seperate the more strictly typed class.

     * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
     *
     * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
     *
     * - The function was renamed from `distanceInWords ` to `formatDistance`
     *   to make its name consistent with `format` and `formatRelative`.
     *
     * - The order of arguments is swapped to make the function
     *   consistent with `differenceIn...` functions.
     *
     *   ```javascript
     *   // Before v2.0.0
     *
     *   distanceInWords(
     *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
     *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 11, 32, 0),
     *     { addSuffix: true }
     *   ) //=> 'in about 1 hour'
     *
     *   // v2.0.0 onward
     *
     *   formatDistance(
     *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 11, 32, 0),
     *     new Date(1986, 3, 4, 10, 32, 0),
     *     { addSuffix: true }
     *   ) //=> 'in about 1 hour'
     *   ```
     *
     * @param {Date|Number} date - the date
     * @param {Date|Number} baseDate - the date to compare with
     * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.
     * @param {Boolean} [options.includeSeconds=false] - distances less than a minute are more detailed
     * @param {Boolean} [options.addSuffix=false] - result indicates if the second date is earlier or later than the first
     * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}
     * @returns {String} the distance in words
     * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required
     * @throws {RangeError} `date` must not be Invalid Date
     * @throws {RangeError} `baseDate` must not be Invalid Date
     * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `formatDistance` property
     *
     * @example
     * // What is the distance between 2 July 2014 and 1 January 2015?
     * const result = formatDistance(new Date(2014, 6, 2), new Date(2015, 0, 1))
     * //=> '6 months'
     *

     * // What is the distance between 1 January 2015 00:00:15
     * // and 1 January 2015 00:00:00, including seconds?
     * const result = formatDistance(
     *   new Date(2015, 0, 1, 0, 0, 15),
     *   new Date(2015, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
     *   { includeSeconds: true }
     * )
     * //=> 'less than 20 seconds'
     *
     * @example
     * // What is the distance from 1 January 2016
     * // to 1 January 2015, with a suffix?
     * const result = formatDistance(new Date(2015, 0, 1), new Date(2016, 0, 1), {
