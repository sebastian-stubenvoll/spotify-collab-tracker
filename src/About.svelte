what is this project?
<p>
this website can help you keep track of all the activity in your collaborative playlist.
once logged in, you will be able to see who added what song by what artist to which playlist how long ago. and it's all sorted chronologically! just keep scrolling to travel back in time. while you browse the page periodically checks if anything has happened and, if anything has, will automatically adjust your feed and tell you. no refreshing required.
</p>
why is this project a thing?
<p>
there's a good chance this isn't something you want (or need). however if you and peers enjoy actively making use of the collaborative playlist feature then this is supposed to serve you as a fairly easy and comfortable way of keeping up with recently added songs across a large quantity of playlists.
</p>
how can i support this project?
<p>
use it. nothing makes this project more worthwhile than people actually finding a use for it and having an improved spotify experience.
